# This is the README file of the project.

#### Here are `Python` scripts that I developed during learning it as a beginner! They mostly cover basic concepts in `Python` such as lists, loops, conditionals, tuples, dictionaries, I/O, etc.

#### Some of the scripts in 'former_scripts' folder are my proposed solutions to problems from the really practical book 'A Practical Introduction to Python Programming' by Brian Heinold.
